I let it [Dm] fall, my [F] heart
And as it [C] fell you also [Bb] claim it
It was [Dm] dark and I was O- [F] ver
Until you [C] kissed my lips and you [Bb] saved me.
 
My [Dm] hands they're [F] strong
But my [C] knees were far too [Bb] weak
To [Dm] stand in your [F] arms without [C] fall into your [Bb] feet
 
But there's a [Bb] side to you that I [Dm] never knew, I never knew
All the [Bb] things you say they were [Dm] never, where never true
And the [Bb] games you play, you [C] always, always win.
 
Chorus: But I set [Dm] fire to the rain
Watch it [C] pour as I touched your face
Let it [Bb] burn while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming at your [Gm] name, your [C] name.
 
When [Dm] lay with [F] you I could [C] stay there
[Bb] Close my eyes, feel you're [Dm] here fore-[F] ver
You and [C] me together, nothing is [Bb] better
 
But there's a [Bb] side to you that I [Dm] never knew, I never knew
All the [Bb] things you say they were [Dm] never, where never true
And the [Bb] games you play, you [C] always, always win
 
Chorus: But I set [Dm] fire to the rain
Watch it [C] pour as I touched your face
Let it [Bb] burn while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming at your [Gm] name, your [C] name.
 
I set [Dm] fire to the rain
And I threw [C] us into te fllames
Well I [Bb] felt something die
Cause I knew that that was the last [Gm] time, the last [C] time.
 
Sometimes I [Dm] wake up by the [F] door
And heard you [C] calling, must be waiting [Bb] for you
Even [Dm] now when we're already [F] over
I can't [C] help myself from looking [Bb] for you.
 
Chorus: But I set [Dm] fire to the rain
Watch it [C] pour as I touched your face
Let it [Bb] burn while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming at your [Gm] name, your [C] name.
 
I set [Dm] fire to the rain
And I threw [C] us into te fllames
Well I [Bb] felt something die
Cause I knew that that was the last [Gm] time, the last [C] time
