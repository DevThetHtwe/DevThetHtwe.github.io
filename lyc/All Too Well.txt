[Intro]
[C]  [G]  [Am]   [F]  [C]  [G]  [Am]   [F]  
 
[Verse]
I [C]walked through the door with [G]you, the air was cold
But [Am]something 'bout it felt like [F]home somehow, and I, 
[C]Left my scarf there at your [G]sister's house
And you [Am]still got it, in your [F][(once)]drawer, even now
 
[Instrumental]
[C]  [G]  [Am]   [F] 
[Verse]
Oh your [C]sweet dispositon and my [G]wide eyed gaze 
We're [Am]singing in the car getting [F]lost upstate
The [C]autumn leaves falling down like [G]pieces into place
And I [Am]can picture it after [F]all these days
 
[Pre-chorus]
And I [C]know it's long gone and, and [G]magics not here no more
And I [Am]might be okay but I'm not [G]fine at [F]all [G]  [Am]   [G] 
 
[Chorus]
'Cause [C]there we are again on that [G]little town street
You [Am]almost ran the red 'cause you were [F]lookin' over at me
Wind in my [C]hair, I was there, I [G]remember it all too [Am]well [F] 
 
[Verse]
Photo [C]album on the counter your [G]cheeks were turning red
You used to be a [Am]little kid with glasses in a [F]twin size bed
And your [C]mothers telling stories 'bout you on a [G]t-ball team
You [Am]taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your [F]future was me
 
[Pre-chorus]
And I [C]know it's long gone and it was [G]nothing else I could do
And I [Am]forget about you long enough to [G]forget why I needed [F][G]to  [Am]   [G] 
 
[Chorus]
'Cause [C]here we are again in the [G]middle of the night
We [Am]dance around the kitchen in the [F]refrigerator light
Down the [C]stairs, I was there, I [G]remember it all too [Am]well [F] 
 
[Instrumental]
[C]  [G]  [Am]   [F]  [G] 
[Verse]
Maybe we got [C]lost in translation maybe I [G]asked for too much
But maybe this [Am]thing was a masterpiece 'til you [F]tore it all up
Running [C]scared, I was there, I re[G]member it all too[Am] wel[F]l
Hey, you [C]call me up again just to [G]break me like a promise
So [Am]casually cruel in the name [F]of being honest
I'm a [C]crumpled up piece of paper [G]lyin' here
Cause I remember it [Am]all all [F]all too [C]well  [G]  [Am]   [F] 
 
[C]Time won't fly it's like I'm [G]paralyzed by it
I'd like to [Am]be my old self again but I'm [F]still tryin' to find it
After [C]plaid shirt days and nights when you [G]made me your own
Now you [Am]mail back my things and I [F]walk home alone
But you [C]keep my old scarf from that [G]very first week
'Cause it [Am]reminds you of innocence and it [F]smells like me
You cant get [C]rid of it 'cause you re[G]member it all too[Am] wel[F]l yeah
 
[Chorus]
'Cause [C]there we are again when I [G]loved you so
[Am]Back before you lost the one real [F]thing you've ever known
It was [C]rare, I was there, I re[G]member it all too[Am] wel[F]l
Wind in my [C]hair, you were there, you [G]remember it oh
Down the [Am]stairs, you were there, you [F]remember it all
It was [C]rare, I was there, I re[G]member it all too[Am] we[F]ll
