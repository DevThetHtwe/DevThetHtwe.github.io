1. He-[Em]llo [G], it's [D]me [C]
I was [Em]wondering [G]if after all these [D]years
You'd like [C]to meet to go [Em]over [G]
Every[D]thing [C]they say that [Em]time's supposed [G]to heal yeah 
but I ain't [D]done much [C]healing
 
He-[Em]llo [G], can you [D]hear me?[C]
I'm in [Em]California [G]dreaming about [D]we used [C]to be
When we were [G]younger [G]and [D]free [C]
I've for-[Em]gotten how it [G]felt before the [D]world fell at our [C]feet
 
There's such a [Em]diffe-[D]rence bet-[Bm]ween [C]us
And a [Em]milli-[D]on [C]miles
 
Chorus: [Em]Hello from the [C]other [G]side [D]
I [Em]must've called [C]a thousand [G]times [D]to tell you
[Em]I'm [C]sorry, for every-[G]thing that I've [D]done
But when I [Em]call you [C]never [G]seem to be [D]home.
 
He-[Em]llo from [C]the out-[G]side [D]
At [Em]least I can [C]say that I've [G]tried [D]to tell you
[Em]I'm [C]sorry, for [G]breaking your [D]heart, but it don't mat-[Em]ter
it [C]clearly doesn't [G]tear you a-[D]part any-[Em]more [G] [D] [C]
 
2. He-[Em]llo [G], how [D]are you? [C]
It's so [Em]typical of [G]me to talk a-[D]bout myself
I'm [C]sorry, I [Em]hope [G]that you're [D]well [C]
Did you [Em]ever make it [G]out of that town
Where [D]nothing ever [C]happened?
It's no [Em]secret [D]
That the [Bm]both of [C]us are run-[Em]ning [D]out of [C]time.
 
Chorus: [Em]Hello from the [C]other [G]side [D]
I [Em]must've called [C]a thousand [G]times [D]to tell you
[Em]I'm [C]sorry, for every-[G]thing that I've [D]done
But when I [Em]call you [C]never [G]seem to be [D]home.
 
He-[Em]llo from [C]the out-[G]side [D]
At [Em]least I can [C]say that I've [G]tried [D]to tell you
[Em]I'm [C]sorry, for [G]breaking your [D]heart, but it don't mat-[Em]ter
it [C]clearly doesn't [G]tear you a-[D]part any-[Em]more [C]
 
* [D]Oooo-[G]ohh, any-[Em]more [C]
[D]Oooo-[G]ohh, any-[Em]more [C]
[D]Oooo-[G]ohh, any-[Em]more [C], any-[D]more
