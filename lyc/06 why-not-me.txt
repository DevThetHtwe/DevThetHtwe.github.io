VERSE 1
[G]Escaping nights without [D]you with shadows on the [Em]wall 
My mind is running [C]wild trying hard not to [G]fall 
You told me that you [D]love me but say I'm just a [Em]friend 
my heart is broken up [C]into pieces 
Cos i [G]know I'll never free my [D]soul 
it's trapped [Em]between true love and being [C]alone 
When my eyes are [G]closed the greatest story [D]told 
I woke and my [Em]dreams are shattered here on the [C]floor 
 
Pre-chorus:
[G]Why oh why tell me [D]why not me 
[Em]Why oh why we were [C]meant to be 
Baby I [G]know I could be [D]all you need 
[Em]Why oh why oh [C]why 
 
Chorus:
I wanna [G]love you 
if [D]you only knew how much I [Em]love you 
So [C]why not me 
 
VERSE 2
[G]The day after [D]tomorrow I'll still be [Em]around 
To catch you when you [C]fall and ever let you [G]down 
you say that we're [D]forever our love will never [Em]end 
I've tried to come up [C]but it's drowning me to [G]know 
you'll never feel my [D]soul 
It's trapped [Em]between true love and being [C]alone 
 
when my eyes are [G]closed the greatest story [D]told 
i woke and my [Em]dreams are shattered here on the [C]floor 
Tell me baby...
