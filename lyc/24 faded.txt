[Am]You were 
the shadow to my [F]light 
Did you feel us [C] 
Another [G]Start 
You fade away.
 
[Am]Afraid our aim
 is out of [F]sight 
Wanna see us [C] 
[G]Alive 
 
Where are you [Am]now [F] 
Where are you [C]now [G] 
Where are you [Am]now 
Was it all in my [F]fantasy 
Where are you [C]now 
Were you only [G]imaginary. 
 
Where are you [Am]now. 
[F]Atlantis. 
Under the [C]sea 
Under the [G]sea. 
 
Where are you [Am]now 
Another [F]dream 
The [C]monsters running wild 
inside of [G]me. 
 
I'm [Am]faded [F] 
I'm [C]faded. 
So [G]lost, 
I'm [Am]faded [F] 
I'm [C]faded 
So [G]lost 
I'm faded.
 
[Am]These shallow
 waters, nevet [F]met 
What I needed [C] 
I'm letting [G]go 
A deeper dive.
 
[Am]Eternal silence of the [F]sea 
I'm breathing [C] 
[G]Alive. 
 
Where are you [Am]now [F] 
Where are you [C]now. [G] 
 
Under the [Am]bright 
But faded lights
You set my [F]heart on fire 
Where are you [C]now 
Where are you [G]now. 
 
WHERE ARE YOU [Am]NOW. 
[F]Atlantis. 
Under the [C]sea 
Under the [G]sea. 
 
Where are you [Am]now 
Another [F]dream. 
 
The [C]monsters running wild 
inside of [G]me 
I'm [Am]faded. [F] 
I'm [C]faded 
So [G]lost, 
I'm [Am]faded [F] 
I'm [C]faded 
So [G]lost, I'm [Am]faded
